# Line-Follower-Robot
A line-following robot is an autonomous vehicle designed to navigate along a predefined path, typically a black line on a white surface. This robot utilizes infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjusts its movement accordingly

🔧 Hardware Components
Arduino UNO – Main controller of the robot

IR Sensors (TCRT5000) – Detects black line on white surface

L298N Motor Driver – Controls direction and speed of motors

2 BO DC Motors – Drives the robot wheels

Chassis Frame – Holds all components together

Rubber Wheels – Ensures grip and smooth movement

9V Battery / Li-ion Pack – Powers the robot and electronics

Jumper Wires, Switch, Buzzer (optional) – For connections and alerts

🌟 Key Features
Follows black line on white surface

Beginner-friendly and reliable

Expandable with extra sensors or wireless modules

🔍 How It Works
IR sensors detect black or white surface

Arduino UNO reads sensor data as digital input

Logic determines direction based on sensor values

Motor driver activates motors accordingly

Robot adjusts direction to stay on the line
